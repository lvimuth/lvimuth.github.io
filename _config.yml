          The project can involve the development of a computer vision system that uses machine learning algorithms and image processing techniques to identify medicinal plants and detect fungal diseases on their leaves. The system can be trained on a dataset of images of different medicinal plants and their corresponding fungal diseases to learn the visual patterns and characteristics of each.

          The project was done as a mini-project at the University. The project aimed to replace the manual gate system with an automated one. A license plate recognition system was developed using YOLO and CNN. The system was tested with a small-scale prototype. Used YOLO and CNN to detect and recognize license plates.Developed a small-scale prototype to simulate the process. Developed a Flask web app on Heroku to interact with the system.

          The objective of this initiative was to design and implement a sophisticated model capable of detecting lung cancer through the analysis of computed tomography (CT) scan images. The project's cornerstone was the development of an algorithm that not only identifies the presence of lung cancer with a high degree of accuracy but also categorizes its progression into specific stages. This endeavor involved intricate image processing techniques and advanced machine learning algorithms to ensure precise diagnostics, ultimately contributing to early detection and personalized treatment strategies.
